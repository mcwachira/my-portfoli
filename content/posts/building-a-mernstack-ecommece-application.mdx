In a series of articles, we are going to learn how to build an e-commerce application using react, node js, express, and MongoDB. By the end of the series we are going to have learned how to :

1. Built rest APIs using node express and MongoDB.
2. Built a mobile app using react native.
3. Built a web application using react js.
4. Carry out testing using cypress.

Here is the git repository if you want to follow along with the series [Github](https://github.com/mcwachira/nodejs-Ecommerce-rest-api)

In the first part of this series, we will focus on building the rest of the API.

## Building The Ecommerce Rest API.

To build our e-commerce API we first have to understand the definition of an API and the definition of rest.

### What is an API?

The word API stands for application programmable interface and it is a set of rules that define how applications can connect to and communicate with each other. Apis are designed using different architectural styles and one of the most popular is rest.

### What is a Rest API

The word REST stands for Representational State Transfer. This means that when a resource is requested by the client using a REST API the requested resource is transferred back with all its relevant information and in a format easily understood by the client.

Rest APIs communicate via HTTP requests to perform basic database function like creating, reading, updating, and deleting records (crud). These functions are performed by the following existing HTTP methods

- POST used to create the resource
- GET used to fetch the resource
- PUT used to update the resource
- DELETE is used to remove the resource

![rest-api.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668083449777/jgxXinqr0.png align="left")

To build the API we are going to use the following

1. nodejs
2. express js Library
3. MongoDB as the database
4. Postman to test our APIs

To build the API we have to have node installed on our pc by going to their website and installing the latest version [nodejs website](https://nodejs.org/en/). After installing node we create an empty folder on our pc and initialized our project using the following command

```plaintext
npm init -y
```

This will enable us to create and initialize a node project and provide us with a package.json file which will contain information about our project like the name of the project, the description, the list of dependencies, and the scripts that will run the application e.t.c After initializing our project we will need to install some dependencies which will be used in making the API but before doing that we need to know the difference between dependencies and dev-dependencies. Dependencies are modules that are required during development and runtime while dev-dependencies are required during development only.

We will start by installing express as a dependency. Express js is a nodejs framework designed to build web applications easily and quickly

```plaintext
npm install --save express
```

We then install nodemon a CLI tool used to restart the nodejs application whenever it detects changes in the application. We will install it as a dev dependency.

```plaintext
npm install -D nodemon
```

after installing the two packages we write a start script in our package.json file to run our node app

```plaintext
  "name": "nodejs-ecommerce-rest-api",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "app.js",
   "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon app.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {

    "express": "^4.18.2",

  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.20"
  }
}
```

Before we begin building our APIs let's first create a small express app that enables us to understand more about express.

```javascript
//app.js
const express = require('express');
const app =  express();

app.get('/', (req, res) =>  {
res.send('This is the Home Page')
});

const port = 8000;
app.listen(port, () =>  {
console.log(`Server is listening on port ${port}...`)
}
```

To run the app we type `npm start` in our terminal and the program starts, and this is what we will see in our terminal

![Screenshot from 2022-11-10 21-03-46.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668103464142/yrrteJg-U.png align="left")

In the code above we are creating an express app that starts a server and listens on port 8000 for connection. Breaking down the code line by line will help us understand the app.

The first line of the code is used to bring in express package into the app. In the second line, we are initializing the express app. In the third line, we use the HTTP method get with a call back function whose parameters are the request and the response object.

The request object **req** is used to enable the express server to receive data from the client while the response object **res** is used to get the data sent from the servers.

In the 4th line, we define a port where our app will start at. In our last line we have the **app.listen()** which is a function that binds and listens to the connections on a specific host and port which in our case is 8000.

Now that we are done with creating a simple express app we can go ahead and build our APIs.

## Creating the MongoDB Database

The easiest way to get started with MongoDB is to use MongoDB Atlas which is a cloud hosted database. They provide a free tier for small projects so we won't have to install MongoDB locally and set up the database. For this, we will need to head first to the MongoDB website [mongoDB](https://mongodb.com/) where you can create an account if you don't have one. After sign up / sign in we go ahead and create a shared cluster as is free

![Screenshot from 2022-11-10 22-51-27.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668109902849/9ghGDrwyK.png align="left")

After creating the cluster we then create our database and for that, we are prompted to create a database user by adding the user name and password.

![Screenshot from 2022-11-10 22-57-54.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668110281910/oRWrbq884.png align="left")

and for the app address, you can click add my current IP to add it. this will enable only your pc to connect with the cluster.

![Screenshot from 2022-11-10 23-01-05.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668110489768/XeFlxV6eX.png align="left")

You can always go back and change it to allow different pc's to connect to the cluster. After setting up the database we will be directed to a page showing our cluster.

![Screenshot from 2022-11-10 23-05-14.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668110727872/ESqhAYWkZ.png align="left")

Here we click the connect button which will enable us to get some options on how we are going to connect to our cluster. For us we will need to pick two options:

1. Connect with MongoDB Compass - this option will enable us to get a connection string which we will use to connect to our cluster via MongoDB compass. MongoDB compass is a graphical tool that will enable us to interact with our mongo DB data. It can be installed in any operating system and the download file can be found on the MongoDB website.
2. Connect your application -This option will also give us a connection string that we will use in our nodejs app to connect to the database. After creating our database and getting our connection string we will go back to our project and install some dependencies which we will need to create our APIs. So in the terminal, we install the following dependencies

```plaintext
npm install mongoose morgan dotenv cors
```

mongoose - it is an Object Data Modelling library for MongoDB. It is used to manage the relationship between data and provide schema validation in MongoDB. In layman's terms mongoose acts as a front end to MongoDB.

morgan - Morgan is a Nodejs express middleware that's used in HTTP servers to log requests, errors, and more to the console.

dotenv - This is a package that is used to load environment variables from the .env into the process.env object. Environment variables are a secure way to configure things that won't change often like authentication keys, URLs, and passwords. It is commonly used to configure ports, DB connections, and hosts that our app should connect to for different environment modes.

cors - Cors stands for Cross-Origin resource sharing. It is used to enable a website to access resources from a server that it does not share a domain, host, or port with. This is done by bypassing the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, which specifies the origins that can access the API.

After installing those packages let's configure the folder structure for our project.

### Folder Structure

There are a lot of different ways to configure our folder structure but this is the way I usually configure mine.

```plaintext
│   app.js          # App entry point
└───routes          # Our routes controllers for all the endpoints of the app
└───config          # configuration files
└───controllers     # Functions for our APIs
└───models          # Database models
└───middlewares     # Contains all the middleware files
└───utils           # Common functions that would be used repetitively
```

The idea is to use the principle of separation of concerns, to move the business logic away from the node.js API Routes.

- routes - contains all routes created using the Express router
- controllers - used to handle the business logic of our application
- config - It's used to store configuration files for third-party services or store our database configurations.
- models - The folder contains the schema files for our projects. Models are responsible for creating and reading documents from the underlying MongoDB database.
- middleware - Contain our middleware files. A middleware is a function that has access to the request object(req), the response object(res), and the next function in the application's request-response cycle.
- utils - Contain helper functions that will be used by different controllers

We finished creating the folder structure. Let's now go ahead and create our database configuration. Let's first start by adding our MongoDB connection string to our env file.

```plaintext
//env file
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://hashnode:testpassword@cluster0.qqzrvhp.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

After doing that we go ahead and create a db.js file in our config folder and add the following code

```plaintext
const mongoose = require("mongoose");


console.log(process.env.MONGO_URI)


const connectDb = async () => {
    try{
        const connect = await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI,{
            useNewUrlParser: true,
            useUnifiedTopology: true,
        })
        console.log(`MongoDb  connected ${connect.connection.host}`)
    }catch(error){
        console.log(`error :${error.messages}`)
        process.exit(1)
    }
}

module.exports = connectDb;
```

We then have to import the connectDb to our app.js for our app to connect to the database.

```plaintext
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const morgan = require('morgan')
require('dotenv/config')
const connectDb = require('./config/db')

connectDb()
```

Now comes the fun part where we define our models, routes, and controllers. Since we are building an e-commerce application we have to think about what our application needs in terms of functionality.

For ecommece applications, we usually need products to sell, categories to place those products in, and users to order and buy the products. So will need to create -Category model - This will be used to define the category and how it will look. So to create our category model will have to create the category schema in our model's folder. It will look like this

```plaintext
const mongoose = require('mongoose')
const categorySchema = new mongoose.Schema({

    name: {
        type: String,
        required: true,


    },
    icon: {
        type: String,


    },
    color:{
        type: String,
    }

}, { timestamps: true })

module.exports = mongoose.model('Category', categorySchema)
```

After creating our model we go ahead and create our category controller. This is how our category controller looks like

```plaintext
//categoryController.js
const Category = require('../models/category')
const mongoose = require('mongoose')


const createCategory = async (req, res) => {
    let category = new Category({
        name: req.body.name,
        icon: req.body.icon,
        color: req.body.color,
    })
    try {

        const newCategory = await category.save();
        res.status(201).json(newCategory)
    } catch (error) {
        return res.status(400).json(
            {
                message: 'the category cannot be created!',
                error: error.message
            })
    }


}



module.exports ={
        createCategory,
}
```

here we are creating our first function which will be async. The createCategory function will be used to create our categories. We then import this function to our categoryRoute.js file where we will create our first route.

To create our route we will need to bring in the express package into our Category route.js file and initialize our router using \*\* express.Router()\*\*. After that, we write our first request which will be a post request. The post request will be used to create a category in our database.

```javascript
const Category = require("../models/category");
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();

const { createCategory } = require("../controllers/categoryController");

router.post("/", createCategory);

module.exports = router;
```

We then Import our router into our app.js file and invoke it using **app.use()**

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const morgan = require("morgan");
const cors = require("cors");
require("dotenv/config");
const connectDb = require("./config/db");
const categoryRoute = require("./routes/category");

//middleware
app.use(express.json());
app.use(cors());
app.use(morgan("tiny")); //used to log request from the frontend

//import myRouter
const categoryRouter = require("./routes/category");

const api = process.env.API_URL;
//routers
app.use(`${api}/products`, productRouter);

connectDb();
const port = 5000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is listening on port ${port}...`);
});
```

Before testing our route we will need to configure the body-parser middleware in our app.js file. A body-parser is a middleware that is used to extract the entire body portion of an incoming request stream and exposes it on req.body

We will add the following to our main js file

````markdown
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

app.use(express.json());
//app.use(bodyParser.json()) //for getting data from our req.body

    ```

After doing this we can test our API route in postman

![Screenshot from 2022-11-11 12-52-58.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668160401548/6l_V1l9qp.png align="left")
and success we have created our first category. now let's check our MongoDB compass and see if the category has been added to the database

![Screenshot from 2022-11-11 12-51-24.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668160304804/jN02Rr3l9.png align="left")
As we can see from the image above the electronics category has been added to our database.

Will then go ahead and create all the other routes and controllers for our category model.
We will begin by creating our fetchAllCategories function which will be used to fetch all the categories from our database. The function will use the **model.find()**method which enables us to get all the categories. The code will look like this.


//categoryController.js 
```
const fetchAllCategories = async (req, res) =&gt; { const categoryList = await Category.find()};

if (!categoryList) { res.status(500).json({ success: false }) }


and in our route, our code will look like this
```

const Category = require('../models/category'); const express = require('express'); const router = express.Router();

const { fetchAllCategories} = require('../controllers/categoryController')

router.get(`/`, fetchAllCategories)

module.exports = router;

```
We then import this route into our app.js and test it postman where will only get one category since we only have one in the database

![Screenshot from 2022-11-11 13-05-13.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668161137248/UzxEgUggd.png align="left")

Now let's add a route that will enable us to fetch a specific category based on its id. This will be useful to us in the front end when you want to fetch a specific category.
To fetch a specific category will use router parameters.

Route parameters are essentially variables derived from named sections of the URL. Express captures the value in the named section and stores it in the req.params property.
The code for fetching a specific category will look like this

```

//categoryController.js const fetchCategoryById = async (req, res) =&gt; { const category = await Category.findById(req.params.id)};

if (!category) { res.status(500).json({ message: 'The category with the given ID was not found.' }) } res.status(200).send(category); console.log(category) }


and in our route, our code will look like this
```

const Category = require('../models/category'); const express = require('express'); const router = express.Router();

const { fetchCategoryById} = require('../controllers/categoryController')

// `:id` is a route parameter. Express will capture whatever // string comes after `/` in the URL and stores it in // \`req.params.id router.get('/:id', fetchCategoryById) module.exports = router;

```

As you can see in our route file we are using the get method to get a specific category by passing the id to the URL.
We test this in postman using an id of one of the categories in our database

![Screenshot from 2022-11-11 13-46-55.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668163624210/m8G4GRGGy.png align="left")
We are successfully able to fetch one category based on its id.

The next route we are going to create will enable us to update our category. Let's say you want to change the name of an existing category. To do this we first create a function that will enable us to fetch the specific category+ based on its id and update it
 **model.findByIdAndUpdate()**.

This method will take the filter we will use. in our case, we will filter using the id of the product, the second value will be the values we want to update for our category and the last option will be an option  ** new** which will be set to true as this in turn enables us to get the document after the update is applied.


We will use the HTTP put method to update our category and the router code will look like this
```

const Category = require('../models/category'); const express = require('express'); const router = express.Router();

const { updateCategory } = require('../controllers/categoryController') router.put('/:id', updateCategory)
module.exports = router;

```
![Screenshot from 2022-11-11 14-45-34.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668167149776/0wVdR_MKW.png align="left")
We test the route and we successfully update the electronics category filter and changed its name to computers.

checking our database we will see that the category has been updated

![Screenshot from 2022-11-11 14-47-39.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668167271517/-YHjbxXEs.png align="left")

The last route we will create will enable us to delete a category from our database.
To do that we will use the **model.findByIdAndDelete* *. This will enable us to delete a category based on a specific id. This is how the delete function in our controller will look like




// const deleteCategory = (req, res) =&gt; 
// { Category.findByIdAnd Delete(req.params.id).then(category =&gt; { if (category) { return res.status(200).json({ success: true, message: 'the category is deleted!' }) } else { return res.status(404).json({ success: false, message: "Category not found!" }) } }).catch(err =&gt; { return res.status(500).json({ success: false, error: err }) }) }

// ```



We will use the HTTP delete method to delete our category and the router code will look like this
```

const Category = require('../models/category'); const express = require('express'); const router = express.Router();

const { deleteCategory } = require('../controllers/categoryController') router.delete('/:id',deleteCategory ) module.exports = router;

When we test the API route in postman we see that it worked and we deleted the computers category from our DB.

![Screenshot from 2022-11-11 15-07-51.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668168488057/q3JlBINqQ.png align="left")
and checking our database we see that the computer category does not exist anymore.

![Screenshot from 2022-11-11 15-11-44.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668168715874/nxXELneYD.png align="left")

Our completed Category controller will look like this

```

const Product = require('../models/product') const Category = require('../models/category') const mongoose = require('mongoose')

const createCategory = async (req, res) =&gt; { let category = new Category({ name: req.body.name, icon: req.body.icon, color: req.body.color, })

console.log(category)

try {

const newCategory = await category.save(); res.status(201).json(newCategory) } catch (error) { return res.status(400).json( { message: 'the category cannot be created!', error: error.message }) }

}

const fetchAllCategories = async (req, res) =&gt; { const categoryList = await Category.find();

if (!categoryList) { res.status(500).json({ success: false }) } res.status(200).send(categoryList); }

const fetchCategoryById = async (req, res) =&gt; { const category = await Category.findById(req.params.id);}

if (!category) { res.status(500).json({ message: 'The category with the given ID was not found.' }) } res.status(200).send(category); console.log(category) }

const updateCategory = async (req, res) =&gt; { const category = await Category.findByIdAndUpdate( req.params.id, { name: req.body.name, icon: req.body.icon, color: req.body.color, }, { new: true } )

if (!category) return res.status(400).send('the category cannot be created!')

res.send(category); }

const deleteCategory = (req, res) =&gt; { Category.findByIdAndRemove(req.params.id).then(category =&gt; { if (category) { return res.status(200).json({ success: true, message: 'the category is deleted!' }) } else { return res.status(404).json({ success: false, message: "category not found!" }) } }).catch(err =&gt; { return res.status(500).json({ success: false, error: err }) }) }

module.exports ={ createCategory, fetchAllCategories, fetchCategoryById, updateCategory, deleteCategory

}
```

our Categoryroute.js file will look like this

```
const Category = require('../models/category'); const express = require('express'); const router = express.Router();

const { createCategory, fetchAllCategories, fetchCategoryById, updateCategory, deleteCategory } = require('../controllers/categoryController')

router.get(`/`, fetchAllCategories)

router.get('/:id', fetchCategoryById)

router.post('/',createCategory)

router.put('/:id', updateCategory)

router.delete('/:id',deleteCategory )

module.exports = router;
```

and our app.js file will look like this

```
const express = require('express'); const app = express(); const cors = require('cors') const morgan = require('morgan') require('dotenv/config') const connectDb = require('./config/db') const categoryRoute=require('./routes/category')

//middleware app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }) ); app.use(express.json()); app.use(cors()) app.use(morgan('tiny')) //used to log request from the frontend

//import my model const Category = require('./models/category')

//import myRouter const categoryRouter = require('./routes/category')

const api = process.env.API\_URL //routers app.use('/categories', categoryRouter)

connectDb() const port = 5000; app.listen(port, () =&gt; { console.log(`Server is listening on port ${port}...`) })

```

### Product Model

To create our product model will have to make the product schema in our model's folder. It will look like this

````

The type property states that each product will be assigned to a specific category via the category id while the ref points to the model we are referencing.


We are done with creating our product model and will head on to create our product controller and routes. Since creating the routes and controllers for our products is similar to that of our category I have gone ahead and created them already and you can access them in the GitHub repository  [github repo](https://github.com/mcwachira/nodejs-Ecommerce-rest-api).

We have only built two APIs, for now, the categories API and the Products API.   In the next part, we are going to continue building out this project by creating the User API, learn about bycrypt js and how we can use it to hash our passwords, and also learn how  to use  Jwt tokens to secure our APIs.

### That's all for now
Don't hesitate to ask any questions in the comments below.
